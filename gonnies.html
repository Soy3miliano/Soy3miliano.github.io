INT. WALSH HOME - DAY
CREDITS OVER VARIOUS CLOSE-UPS of the goonies' HANDS and
FACES as they perform the secret goony handshake.. It is a
very poetic, beautifully synchronized series of movements
which displays a sense of kinship and brotherhood. We hear
the VOICE OF MIKEY, reciting the GOONY OATH, over these
images.
MIKEY (V.O.)
"I will never betray my goon dock
friends, We will stick together until
the whole words ends, Through heaven
and hell, and nuclear war, Good pals
like us will stick like tar, In the
city, or the country, or the forest,
or boonies, I am proudly declared,
one of the goonies!"

FADE TO BLACK:
1A 1A INT. JAIL - CELL BLOCK - DAY
FADE IN: CLOSE-UP. The leathery, bullish face of a JAIL
GUARD. He SHOUTS.
GUARD
Feed time!
CAMERA PULLS BACK. The guard stands in a dimly lit prison
HALLWAY. Rows of JAIL CELLS stretch along the side walls.
Crowded with PRISONERS. The prisoners SHOUT and JEER at the
guard. He removes his wooden BILLY CLUB. Giving a HARD RAP
to the bars. It ECHOES through the prison. The guard
SNARLS.
GUARD
The longer you animals bark...the
colder yer' lunch gets.
The prisoners SIMMER DOWN. The guard inserts a key into the
MASTER LOCK. All of 'the cell doors OPEN. SIMULTANEOUSLY.
The prisoners RUSH OUT. HUNGRY. The guard SHOUTS.
GUARD
Single file. Single file.
The prisoners crowd into a LINE. They PASS the watchful
guard, who taps his palm with the threatening billy club.
Two ASSISTANT GUARDS lead the prisoners into another
hallway. Toward the CAFETERIA. When all of the prisoners
have exited, the guard turns to FOLLOW. He PAUSES. Hearing
a NOISE. A CREAKING. The guard TURNS. He sees SOMETHING.
At hallway's END. In the LAST cell. A DARK FIGURE.
SWINGING back and forth. The guard WALKS to the cell.
CURIOUS. CAUTIOUS. Hand GRIPPING his gun. He STOPS.

:
2 REV: 10-23-84
Outside of the OPEN cell door. He PEERS inside. He is met
with a SHOCKING SIGHT.
2 INT. JAKE'S- CELL - DAY
The body of JAKE FRATELLI, a 33 year old excitable boy, *
strong, muscular, with the face of a KILLER. JAKE is James
Caan on speed. He HANGS from a rusty ceiling pipe. His belt
is wrapped AROUND HIS NECK. His eyes are CLOSED. His
tongue HANGS OUT. Face frozen in a GHASTLY position. His
body SWAYS. An obvious SUICIDE. A NOTE is pinned to Jake's
chest. The guard ENTERS the cell. He GRABS the note.
READING it to himself.
GUARD
"You schmuck! You really think I'd
be stupid enough to kill myself?" (puzzled)
Huh?
The guard LOOKS UP. Jake's eyes are OPEN. He is SMILING.
VERY ALIVE. Before the guard can react, Jake quickly
lifts his KNEE. SLAM! Into the guard's JAW. The guard
HITS the floor. OUT COLD. Jake BOOSTS himself out of
the noose. We see that the noose is actually attached to
CONTRAPTION that fits around Jake's WAIST. Jake LOOKS
into the hallway. Making sure the coast is CLEAR. He
begins to UNBUTTON the guard's shirt.

EXT. JAIL - DAY
Jake RUNS from the jail. A blaring ALARM sounds! A GROUP *
OF GUARDS run out of the prison, in PURSUIT of Jake. CAMERA
PANS TO a waiting BLACK, nondescript, OFF ROAD VEHICLE.
Leaning out the window of the driver's side, puffing on a
cigarette, is MAMA FRATELLI. She is a 56 year old, heavyset
woman, with grey hair and a MENACING, EVIL face.She is
part Marjorie Main, part Jungle cat. Her son, FRANCIS
FRATELLI, -stands outside of the car, holding a can of
GASOLINE. Francis is a 31 year old man with dark hair and
crazed eyes. He resembles Victor Jory as Injun Joe in the
1938 film "Tom Sawyer". He has just poured a STREAM of
gasoline several feet in front of the OFF ROAD VEHICLE. The
cops have nearly CAUGHT UP with Jake. Guns DRAWN, they are
ready to SHOOT! Mama nonchalantly FLICKS her lit cigarette
to the ground. The cigarette IGNĪTES THE GASOLINE. This
creates a literal WALL OF FIRE between the cops and JAKE.
Jake and Francis HOP into the car. The Off Road Vehicle
DRIVES OFF.

mirror. A second police car joins the chase. The Police
are GAINING on them.

THE POLICE CARS FOLLOW. IN HOT PURSUIT down the steep hill.

takes a SHORT CUT, through a STOP N' SNACK PARKING LOT. The
O.R.V. nearly HITS a Mexican woman, ROSALITA. She is ASKING
DIRECTIONS from the store owner, an elderly woman named
SYLVIA KEESTER. Rosalita watches in SHOCK as the two police
cars shoot past her. In PURSUIT of the O.R.V.
EXT. HOUSE WITH BAD PLUMBING - DAY
The CHASE continues through A RESIDENTIAL SECTION of town.
CAMERA PANS TO ONE PARTICULAR HOUSE, SEVERAL FEET AWAY. We
DOLLY INTO THE KITCHEN WINDOW.
8 INT. KITCHEN WITH BAD PLUMBING - DAY
MOUTH sits on the kitchen sink, watching an old BLACK and
WHITE MOVIE on T.V. Several cop cars CHASE James Cagney's
car, complete with POLICE SIRENS and FLYING BULLETS.
Mouth's Father, THE PLUMBER, works on the pipes below. WE
SEE THE ONCOMING CHASE through the kitchen window. But
Mouth is TRANSFIXED by the television screen. Mouth's
FATHER screams.
FATHER
Turn down that goddamn T.V. and come
help me with these pipes!
Mouth TRIES to turn down the T.V. but the volume just seems
to get LOUDER and LOUDER, as the real chase blazes past the
window over Mouth's shoulder, all of it UNSEEN by Mouth.
SECONDS before the chase passes the kitchen window, Mouth's
Father hits the WRONG PIPE. A GUSH OF WATER blasts through
the sink drain. It DOUSES Mouth and SPLATTERS the window.
This creates a CURTAIN OF WATER that BLOCKS Mouth's VIEW of
the chase.

9 EXT. JUNKYARD- DAY
DATA searches through an enormous trash bin, picking up
discarded WIRES, CABLES, etc. Data is wearing a WALKMAN.
It DROWNS out all sounds. He is tinkering with one of his
crude inventions, A BELT BUCKLE SUCTION GUN. Data DECIDES
to test his invention. He STEPS away from the trash bin.
He PRESSES a button on his BELT that reads "OUT"! The BELT
BUCKLE flips open. A suction cup, attached to a long wire,
SHOOTS OUT of the buckle. The suction cup STICKS to the
trash bin! Data HITS the "IN" button on his belt. Another
mechanism causes the wire to REEL the trash bin TOWARD DATA!
Data TRIES to turn it OFF! Doesn't work! Suddenly, the
trash bin comes to a STOP! Wedged between TWO TELEPHONE
POLES! The strong FORCE of the WIRE begins to PULL DATA
INTO THE BIN! He CAN'T STOP IT! Data is PULLED inside the
bin, an instant before the CHASE PASSES BY!
10 INT. O.R.v. DAY
The SPEEDOMETER wavers past 100 mph. Mama GLANCES to the
rearview. The cops are still GAINING. Mama takes a SHARP
TURN. OUT of the junkyard.
THE CHASE CONTINUES. Moving along the MAIN ROAD.
11 INT. O.R.V. DAY
Mama is FRENZIED. Wanting to LOSE THE COPS. She makes a
QUICK TURN. OFF of the main road. Through the grassy field
of a high school football field.
12 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
TINA TURNER'S "Better Be Good To Me" BLASTS from the stadium
speakers. A group of high school CHEERLEADERS practice
along with the music. ANDY, one of the prettiest-girls in
town, LEADS the chèerleaders. They are forming a PYRAMID.
The chase PASSES BY in the background, UNBEKNOWNST to the
CHEERIEADERS. The MUSIC IS TOO LOUD for them to hear.
THE O.R.V. LEAPS a small ditch, out of the parking lot,
through a wire fence.

* 12A EXT. STREET - DAY
The Fratelli O. R.V. squeals down the street, rapidly
overtaking:
A LARGE VAN. The elderly CAB OCCUPANTS (SIMON & SIMONE
SIMIAN) exchange a contented glance. Simon now looks at
his side view mirror, his expression instantly changing
to panic as:
SIMONE
Simon, look out!
The van swerves hard right, allowing the Fratelli O.R.V.
to screech around it. Now suddenly looming up from behind
the right side: A POLICE PATROL CAR!
Simon swings the large van back hard left to accomodate
the patrol car as:
A SECOND PATROL CAR starts to overtake the van fram the
left side! The van spins in confusion, blocking the road
sideways as A THIRD PATROL CAR skids to a stop in front of
it, barely avoiding a crash.
The OFFICER inside jumps out, heads quickly for the van cab.
OFFICER
This road only runs two ways,
pop, so...
He suddenly stops as he hears FRANTIC POUNDING and AGONIZED
SCREAMS from within the rear of the van! Rushing to the side
door, the Officer starts to jerk it open as:
SIMON
No! Don't! Wait!!:
Too late! The door flies open and TWO HUGE GORILLAS leap
out, decking the Officer in the process. Grunting and
squealing with delight at their new-found freedom, they
disappear around the corner of the van.
ANGLE ON FAR SIDE OF VAN
The dazed Officer rounds the van in pursuit, scratches his
gead, puzzled. The Gorillas have disappeared. In b.g. we now
see, printed on the side of the van: BONZO THE GREAT AND HIS
MATE, with a picture of them driving a small red car.

12B EXT. PUTTING GREEN & GOLF CLUB DAY
A neatly manicured putting green, part of an elegant
country club.
12B
TROY PREKINS and his FATHER stand on the green. In b.g.
a little red golf cart sits, holding their clubs. Troy
hovers seriously over a putt, using the knock-kneed stance
made famous by Arnold Palmer.
ANGLE ON BUSHES
TROY
How's this, daddy?
MR. PERKINS
Don't lock your knees when you
putt, son. Makes you look like
you have to go to the bathroom.
Here. Watch me...
The two Gorillas emerge from the bushes, now catching
sight of the red golf cart. Eyes dancing with delight,
they circle it curiously, then hop in as:
BACK TO GREEN
Troy has heard something, wheels in time to see the Gorillas
take off in the cart! His jaw drops in disbelief.
TROY
Daddy...daddy! Two huge hairy
things just stole our cart!
Mr. Perkins spins around. The cart with the Gorillas is
disappearing into the distance. He squints after it, enraged.

MR. PERKINS
Hairy things, my ass! That's George
and Ethel Higgenbottom! I'd recognize
them anywhere!

COASTAL TOWN.
17 EXT. MARINA - DAY

The cars are headed for a MARINA. Several FISHING BOATS are
docked here. STEF, a 16 year old girl, WORKS with her
Father on a small FISHING BOAT. Seconds before the CHASE
passes, Stef, wearing a mask and snorkel, ducks her head
into a tank of water, sorting lobsters and crabs. As the
chase PASSES out of sight, Stef RESURFACES. She's MISSED
all of it.

CHUNK stands in the window. He is PLAYING a video game,
alternating between bits of a giant PIZZA SLICE and a
chocolate MILKSHAKE. The REFLECTION of the chase is VISIBLE
in the video game window. Chunk TURNS from the window,
clumsily SPILLING the milkshake over his shirt and SMEARING
the window with pizza. Chunk STARES at the chase. He sees
the countless BULLETHOLES in the O.R.V. THE POLICE CARS
follow. Chunk's eyes are WIDE. STARTLED by the exciting
chase. He's the only GOONY who's seen it.

21 EXT. STREET - NEAR O.R.V. RACE START - DAY 21
Mama CHECKS the rearview mirror, seeing the police closing
in. The boys LOOK at her in horror.
JAKE
22
We've had it, Ma.
But Mama has NOT LOST her confidence. There is a certain
GLEAM in her eyes, as if she KNOWS something. She TURNS to
her sons.
MAMA
Duck down, boys!
The boys OBEY Mama. Mama REACHES below the seat and removes
a HELMÉT. She puts the helmet over her head and pulls down
the DARK face visor.
THE O.R.V.
makes a sudden TURN. The Police try to FOLLOW. Mama turns
onto the town's MAIN STREET, where a crowd of people have
gathered to view THE CAULDRON POINT O.R.V. RACE.

23 EXT. O.R.V. RACE STARTING POINT - DAY 23
Forty NONDESCRIPT OFF-ROAD VEHICLES line up at the starting
line. All of their drivers wear HELMETS, their dark face
visors PULLED DOWN.
MAMA'S O.R.V. drives up to the STARTING LINE and JOINS THE
RACE. The STARTING FLAG is waved. The RACE BEGINS. THE
POLICE CARS stop at the starting line. The POLICEMEN get
out. Guns RAISED. Ready to SHOOT. But as the countless
vehicles pass, the Policemen can only STARE IN CONFUSION.
Mama's O.R.V. is LOST in the crowd of similar vehicles.
Her face is HIDDEN in the crowd of similar face helmets.
The race DISAPPEARS over a hill.
DISSOLVE TO:
24 EXT. O.R.V. RACE STREET - DAY 24
Ridden with bulletholes, Mama's O.R.V. turns away from the
race, taking an ALTERNATE ROUTE.
25 INT. O.R.V. 25
Mama removes her HELMET. She and the boys are LAUGHING.
They have LOST the cops. They are FREE.
26 EXT. STREET BY WALSH HOUSE - DAY
CAMERA STAYS with the O.R.V., as it cruises through the
"GOON DOCKS". A small VILLAGE, located in and around the
26
docks. Made up of HOMES and SMALL SHOPS. Several FISHERMAN
and BLUE COLLAR WORKERS live here. As the O.R.V. drives out
of town, the CAMERA PANS TO
27 EXT. WALSH HOME - DAY
A 3 STORY house. SIMPLE. PLAIN. This home is in slightly
better condition than the others in the Goon Docks. CAMERA
DOLLIES into the home's picture window. A 13 year old boy
STARES out the window. MIKEY WALSH. He has obviously JUST
MISSED the chase. He gives an ANGRY, BORED shrug.
MIKEY
Nuthin' exciting ever happens around
here anyway!

28 INT. WALSH HOME - RECREATION ROOM 28
Mikey is a 13 year old HYPOCHONDRIAC. CUTE. A wiry, SKINNY
body. SHORT for his age. BRACES. SHAGGY brown hair. A
"BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN" concert T-shirt. FADED Levis. VELCRO
sneakers. Mikey is in that AWKWARD stage of adolescence.
His entire body is going through a CHANGE. Mikey gives
himself a SHOT OF PROMOTENE MIST. Angrily STARING out the
window.
MIKEY
Who needs the goon docks! Who needs
this house! I can't wait to get
outta' here!
Really?
BRAND (O.S.)
Mikey TURNS from the window. His brother, BRAND, hangs
UPSIDE DOWN from a chinning bar. In the BACKGROUND. He is
attached to the bar by METAL ANKLETS. Brand looks NOTHING
like Mikey. Brand is a HANDSOME, MUSCULAR youth. A JOCK.
His eyes are deep BLUE. His hair DIRTY BLONDE. He wears
gym shorts and a half T-shirt over his TANNED BODY. Mikey
gives an HONEST SIGH, letting his TRUE feelings through.
MIKEY
Naw. I was just tryin' to make
myself feel better...tryin' to dilute
myself...'er, dilate myself?...ah
...dictate?
BRAND
"Delude" yourself.
Yeah.
MIKEY
BRAND
I know how ya' feel, wimp. I sure am
gonna miss this place.
CAMERA FOLLOWS Mikey inside the house. We are in the
RECREATIỔN ROOM of the Walsh home. CLUTTERED middle class.
Sears and Roebuck FURNITURE. Montgomery Ward TELEVISION.
J.C. Penney OIL PAINTINGS. Mikey SITS on the sofa. He
OPENS a "MAD MAGAZINE" to the back cover. Mikey STARES at
Al Jaffee's "FOLD IN". Mikey sits, trying to FIGURE out the
Fold In. He REPEATS the answer to himself. He then FOLDS
the magazine together. He has GUESSED the correct answer.
He TOSSES the magazine on the floor. Mikey STARES.

PRANKSTER. A CLOWN. A 15 year old RICH LITTLE. TALL.
GAWKY. CURLY, unkempt hair. A HOMELY kid. He wears a blue
plumber's SHIRT, JEANS, and SNEAKERS. Across his shirt's
back, bright yellow letters spell out: "DEVEREUX'S
PLUMBING". His shirt is still SOAKING WET from the earlier
plumbing fiasco. A WRENCH, SCREWDRIVER and other PLUMBING
TOOLS poke out of his back pocket. Mouth has a perpetual
SMIRK on his face. A devilish GLEAM in his eye. He looks
around the room, noticing the feeling of DEPRESSION in the
air. Mouth tries to LIVEN things up.
MOUTH
Wait?...What's this?...Finklestein's
Funeral parlor?...Lookit' you guys!
Lyin' around like it was a Nuclear
Saturday! C'mon dudes! This is our
last weekend together! The last
GOONY weekend! We should be goin'

John Belushi impression)
But NOO0000....! YOU had to screw it
up. You had to go and flunk your
driving test.
Brand reaches out to HIT Mouth. Mouth JUMPS BACK. Out of
Brand's REACH. They are INTERRUPTED by the sound of a
ringing GATE BELL. Mouth TURNS.
MOUTH
Jerk alert!
Mouth POINTS to the SLIDING GLASS DOORS. LAWRENCE "CHUNK"
COHEN is OUTSIDE of the gate. He is RINGING the bell.
Chunk is 14 years old. PUDGY. CLUMSY. Chunk is a chronic
LIAR, the king of FIBS. He wears a light summer JACKET. A
bright colored HAWAIIAN SHIRT. Large plaid BERMUDA SHORTS.
BLACK knee socks. Brand NEW sneakers. Chunk SHOUTS to the
guys.
CHUNK
Hey, guys...Ya' gotta' let me in! I
just saw the most amazing thing...

First ya' gotta' do the "Truffle
Shuffle".

It's obvious that Mouth WON'T let Chunk inside. Chunk
SIGHS. He LIFTS up his SHIRT. Chunk EXPOSES his soft,
pudgy midsection. Chunk begins to TWIST and SHAKE. His
belly JIGGLES. Mouth is bent over with LAUGHTER. Mikey is
not AMUSED. He RUNS to the window, GLARING at Mouth.
MIKEY
Cut it out, Mouth.
Mikey OPENS the window. He drops a STONE out of the window.
In RUBE GOLDBERG fashion, the rock causes a chain of events
that make the gate open for Chunk. Chunk HURRIES through
the gate. He ENTERS the house and EXCITEDLY looks at the
boys.
CHUNK
You guys shoulda' seen it...cop
cars...chasin' this four wheel deal
...it was the most amazing thing I
ever saw!
MIKEY
More amazing than the time Michael
Jackson came over to your house to
use the bathroom?
MOUTH
More amazing than the time you ate
your weight in Straw Hat pizza?
BRAND
More amazing than the time you saved
those old people from that nursing
home fire?
CHUNK
Honest you guys. This time it's for
real.
NO ONE believes Chunk. Suddenly, we HEAR the JAMES BOND
THEME! It ECHOES from outside. With that, as if it were
some sort of ritual, Mikey STANDS and opens the window.
MIKEY'S P.O.V.
Mikey SEES RICKY "DATA" WANG. A 13 year old TECHNICAL
GENIUS. Data is CHINESE. Small FRAMED. THIN. He wears
circular, wire rimmed SPECTACLES. A "PRINCE" T-shirt.
JEANS. NIKES. He is never seen without his LARGE, JAPANESE

29 ВАСКРАСK and FLOWING WHITE CAPE. His dark eyes are
(Cont'd) PIERCING. INTELLIGENT. Data sees himself as Agent 007.
Data STANDS on the window of his home. He has ATTACHED
himself to a clothes line that CONNECTS Mikey's house to
Data's. A LARGE PORTABLE CASSETTE player is STRAPPED to
Data's chest. The Bond Theme BLARES from the cassette.
Data FLIES from his house to Mikey's. He SHOOTS through the
open window, and FALLS into Mikey, who shoots back,
colliding with the bottom half of upside-down Brand, who in
turn arcs up, clunking Chunk. Chunk FALLS BACKWARDS and
KNOCKS a miniature MARBLE REPLICA of Michaelangelo's DAVID
to the floor. The statue lands with a THUD! Chunk
NERVOUSLY picks up the statue. It seems to be in ONE PIECE.
But he is met with a SHOCKING SIGHT. The statue's penis has
CRACKED OFF. Mikey gives himself another SHOT of Promtene
Mist, and picks up the broken statue. He HOLDS the statue
in one hand and the penis in the other. Mikey PANICs,
holding out the broken penis high in the air.
MIKEY
Oh my God! This is my Mom's favorite
piece!
MOUTH
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't!
Data OPENS a map and looks at the guys.

started.

Also got the highest murder rate in
the Country.

Well, that's where we're movin' when
_ we lose our house tomorrow.

30 GOONIES - P.O.V. 30
Three MEN in leisure suits are looking at Mikey's home.
They seem to be discussing the entire area. One of them
carries a surveyor's TRANSIT. They point, gesture and even
laugh. One man picks up a straight branch and imitates a
golf swing.
BRAND
Lookit' em. Smilin'.
MOUTH
Practic'ly droolin.
DATA
They can't wait until tomorrow when
they foreclose on all the
whatevers...

Glasses of death!
He opens his JACKET and REMOVES the cassette player. Inside
of his shirt, is a CRUDE DEVICE that is covered with
different CORDS. Attached to the cords are SMALL, COLOR
CODED PLASTIC RINGS. Data PULLS one of the cords. Two
rubber tipped DARTS fly out of the sides of Data's glasses.
The darks MALFUNCTION, pull off Data's glasses, and ATTACH
themselves to the window. Angry, he SCREAMS.
DATA
Pinchers of peril!

He pulls ANOTHER CORD. A mechanical device, very similar to
the "chest buster" in "Alien", BURSTS out of Data's chest.
The device is PLASTIC, MECHANICAL CHATTERBOX TEETH, with a
homemade super spring for super grip. It shoots forward
ACROSS THE ROOM. The teeth are attached to a thick METAL
COIL, Ssimilar to a SLINKY. The teeth GRASP ONTO the Walsh
DRAPES and HANG THERE. Data TRIES to pull a few more cords.
NOTHING works. Data is LOSING his temper, ready to EXPLODE.
Mouth puts his ARM on Data's shoulder to CALM him.

KIND face. Her arm is in a SLING. BROKEN. Standing with
her is Rosalita, a middle-aged, pudgy MEXICAN woman. The
new MAID (whom we've seen in the first scene).
Mikey quickly passes the broken statue of David BEHIND HIS
BACK, to Chunk. Chunk nervously COVERS the broken statue
with his jacket. Irene LOOKS at Mikey and Brand.

Yes. Right. Anuerism.
Irene TURNS and EXITS with Mouth and Rosalita. Chunk
CATCHES HIS BREATH. He PICKS up the statue. A large HOLE
surrounds the statue's groin. Chunk gives a HOPEFUL look to
Mikey.

How's that?
The boys BREAK UP with laughter. Brand SLAPS Chunk in the
head.
CAMERA CIRCLES to the FRONT OF THE STATUE. Chunk has
glued the penis on UPSIDE DOWN.

Thank you, Clarke. That was so nice

Chunk PICKS up the statue and gives it to her. Irene HOLDS

She REMOVES the leaf. The penis begins to FALL OFF the

Mikey sees this and takes a hit from the Promotene Mist.
Rosalita is, of course, shocked and makes the sign of the

You want a breathin' problem? You

Brand holds Mikey in a strangling headlock. Mikey is
wheezing, coughing. Mikey struggles in the background.
Brand finally pushes Mikey away.
Mouth, pondering something, looks at Mikey.

Mikey FOLLOWS the guys OFFSCREEN.
CUT TO:
INT. ATTIC
DARK. DUSTY. The attic is crowded with historical Cauldron
Point museum pieces. They date from the middle and late
SIXTEENTH CENTURY. There are OIL PAINTINGS, SCULPTURES,
antique FURNITURE, COSTUMES, WHALING HARPOONS, PIRATE AND
FISHING MEMORABILIA, etc.
A LARGE SKYLIGHT looms over the priceless collection.
BLACK, RAGING storm clouds are visible through the skylight
windows. The. oncoming RUMBLING OF THUNDER can be heard.
The boys enter through a TRAP DOOR in the floor. Brand is
FIRST. He shines his FLASHLIGHT through the attic. The
others FOLLOW. Mikey is the last to clumb inside. He sees
the attic for the FIRST TIME. SHOCKED. AMAZED. All of the
boys stare wide eyed at the roomful of items.
MOUTH
I can't believe somethin' this cool
is in your house.
CHUNK
Yeah. We only keep old Christmas
decorations in our attic.
THUNDERCRACK! A FLASH OF LIGHTENING. From the skylight

Mikey LIES on the floor. Catching his breath.
MIKEY
Can we go now? It's dusty up here.
My hay fever's actin' up.
Brand leads Mikey and the others on a trek through the
attic. Mikey follows. Suddenly, a HIGH PITCHED VOICE
INTERRUPTS.
MOUTH (O.S.)
Mikey...Oh, Mikey...You're such a
cute little boy.:.Come and kiss me..,
The boys turn to the direction of the voice. It ECHOES from
behind the tattered OIL PAINTING of the naked woman and
Pirate Captain. A TONGUE juts out of a tear in the woman's
mouth, LASCIVIOUSLY licking its lips. Mikey STARES.
SHOCKED. Brand and Data SHARE a chuckle. Suddenly, a
FINGER pops out of each of the woman's nipples. The fingers
twist and turn. Creating a bizarre image. Mouth calls out,
again imitating a woman.
MOUTH (O.S.)
Come here, Mikey. Make me feel like
a woman.
MIKEY
Stop bein' so perverted, Mouth.
You're wreckin' the painting.
Mouth's head POPS UP from behind the painting.
MOUTH
Easy, dude. It was already trashed.
The kids continue WALKING through the attic. They
INVESTIGATE the various ITEMS.
CHUNK..
What's all this stuff?
MIKEY
The museum did some kinda' show...ya'

Mikey SHRUGS.
The boys RUMMAGE through the items. Each of the boys GRABS
a particular piece of Pirate CLOTHING or EQUIPMENT. Mikey
puts on an EYE PATCH. Mouth and Data find large PIRATE HÄTS
with feathers. Brand GRABS a SWORD. Chunk puts on a Pirate
COAT and SCARF.
As the boys continue to investiage, Data stares in awe.
DATA
Just think of it...All this stuff
belonged to guys who walked on the
same ground that we do...went
swimmin' in the same Ocean, breathed
the same air...
CHUNK
Yeacchhh. They had to breathe the
Herring Factory air too?
DATA
Naw...they didn't have herring then.
This was right after Christopher
Columbus...the 16th century...they
only had ships. They were adventure
guys and explorers...they made maps
and captured Indians and spent all
their time killin' each other with
swords...ya' know...Errol Flynn
stuff.
Mikey flips through a collection of framed portraits and
photographs, He SPOTS something that catches his interest.
A FRAMED MAP. But the map is impossible to read. It is
covered by a YELLOWED, DUSTY PIECE OF GLASS. Mikey tries to
remove the FRAME. Won't budge. He TURNS over the map. The
back is covered by a sheet of WOOD. There is only one way
to read the map: Break the glass. Mikey can't bring
himself to do it.

Mikey holds out the map to Chunk.
MIKEY
Hey, Chunk...hold this for me.
Chunk gives a NOD. He takes the map from Mikey. Mikey
turns. Pretending to examine another framed picture.
WAITING. Within a matter of seconds Chunk loses his
balance. He drops the map. It hits the floor. Its glass
covering shatters into a million pieces. Mikey picks up the
map. He feigns an ANGRY look at Chunk.
MIKEY
Can't you do anything right?
Chunk gives an embarrassed shrug.
Mikey picks up the map. He removes a few small remaining
pieces of glass. The map easily slides out of the frame.
Along with a small, golden DOUBLOON that is fixed in the
map's frame. Mikey studies the map and the doubloon. The
map is now completely visible. It is beautifully detailed.
ELABORATE. HAND PAIÑTED. All of the writing on the map is
in SPANISH. The map is signed "ONE EYED WILLY"! Mikey
STARES at the signature. There is an intricate drawing of a
coastline. The coastline leads to a mountainous cliff.
Below the cliff is a large "X". CAMERA DOLLIES TOWARD THE

Mikey is FASCINATED by the. map. Brand suddenly grabs the
map out of Mikey's hand. The other guys gather around, all
wearing various pieces of Pirate clothing and equipment.
Chunk 1ooks over Mikey's shoulder, studying the Doubloon.

Everyone gives Mouth a puzzled look. Mouth raises his hand

biggest pirate of his time! Mу
Dad told me all about him one night.

MIKEY
(ignoring him, to

He had millions in treasure, see,
but the King sent his ships after
him. So Willy took his ship,
called the INFERNO, and ducked
into this cave to hide. But the
King's men sealed him up inside it
with cannon fire.

MIKEY
You're a lot prettier than that,
Andy.
Andy SMILES. Giving a casual, BROTHERLY, ruffle to Mikey's
hair. Mikey SMILES. In HEAVEN.
Meanwhile, Chunk still has his head BURIED IN THE FREEZER.
Troy NOTICES. He WALKS over. He BRINGS the freezer door
down on Chunk's head. TRAPPING Chunk in the freezer. Chunk
PANICS. Troy CHUCKLES.
TROY
My Mom's makin' a "Goon Pizza"
tonight: She's gonna need some
frozen dough.
Mikey notices. He SHOUTS to Troy.
MIKEY
Why don't you leave 'im alone?!?
Troy PAUSES. He RELEASES his grip on Chunk. Troy WALKS
back to Mikey.
TROY
Did I hear right? Did I hear a Goony
telling me what to do?

Troy TOWERS over Mikey. He's ready to HIT Mikey, when he
notices the ANCIENT MAP. RESTING on the floor. He REALIZES
that it's important to Mikey. He TURNS from Mikey and GRABS
the old map. Mikey CLAWS at Troy.
MIKEY
Let go. That's art you're messin'
with.
Troy holds the map HIGH in the air. ABOVE Mikey's reach.
Troy is CONFUSED by the map. But he realizes its IMPORTANCE
to the boys. Troy grabs a pack of cigarette TOBACCO from
the counter. He POURS the tobacco out onto the map. He
begins to ROLL the map. Like a CIGARETTE. He gives an EVIL
grin to the boys.
TROY
Just can't get rolling papers like
this anymore.
Mikey TRIES to grab the map. Troy gives him a HARD SHOVE.
It KNOCKS Mikey to the floor. Troy FINISHES rolling the
large "cigarette". He removes a Butane LIGHTER from his
pocket. FLICK. A large FLAME APPEARS. Troy MOVES the
flame to the end of the "cigarette". He LIGHTS UP! The
boys WATCH in horror as Troy takes a LONG PUFF. The end of
the map BURNS! CRINKLING! Mikey HIDES his eyes. Troy
blows out SMOKE RINGS. He gives a relieved SIGH. A few
more puffs and the map will be destroyed! Troy moves to
take ANOTHER PUFF. Mouth WALKS up. He RAISES his eyebrow,
doing his JACK NICHOLSON impersonation.
MOUTH
Ya' know...the way you're puffing' on
that cigarette...it reminds me of
somethin'.
TROY
Yeah? What's that?
MOUTH
The time I french kissed your Mother.
Troy's eyes fill with MURDER. He DROPS the map. LEAPING
for Mouth. Mikey quickly GRABS the map. STOMPING out the
fire. Troy has TACKLED Mouth. He is THROWING punches:
Mouth COVERS his face. Mikey LEAPS onto Troy. Mikey GRABS
Troy around the neck, trying to pull him OFF MOUTH.
In the background, Data tries to HELP Mikey! Data opens his
shirt and PŪLLS A CORD! He SHOUTS "SMOKE SCREEN"! À RUBBER
GARDEN HOSE shoots out of Data's sleeve. But instead of
emitting a steady stream of smoke, the hose slowly SMOLDERS.
Data holds his arm in pain, as if it were ON FIRE. He RUNS

to an ICE MACHINE and burries his arm INTO THE ICE! A smile 49
(Cont'd) of RELIEF covers his face.
Meanwhile, Troy is busy DEFENDING himself against Mikey.
Troy turns and GRABS Mikey with his left hand. Troy PULLS
BACK his right hand, ready to PUNCH Mikey in the face. As
Troy's hand FLIES TOWARD Mikey, it is suddenly GRABBED,
STOPPED in midair, by another HAND. CAMERA PULLS BACK. We
see that BRAND has grabbed hold of Troy's fist. Brand
GLARES at Troy.
BRAND
Nobody hits my brother except me!
AFRAID of Brand, Troy gets off Mikey. The boys are
RELIEVED. Brand GRABS Troy by the shirt. Ready to FIGHT.
Troy LOOKS away. SCARED. Mikey WATCHES, his eyes beaming
with PRIDE. Brand RELEASES his grip on Troy. Troy STANDS.
FORCING a cocky grin, he looks at all of the goonies.
TROY
Can't wait till Monday...when my Dad
kicks you all out in the street.
(imitates golf swing)
While you goonies are pilin' all your
stuff into moving vans...I'11 be
teeing off on what used to be your
front lawns.
Troy CHUCKLES. He TURNS to Andy.
TROY
Our court time starts in five
minutes. I'll be waiting outside.
Andy gives a NONCHALANT shrug. Brand TURNS to Andy. He
shoots her a JEALOUS look. Troy STRUTS out of the STOP 'N
SNACK. THROUGH the window, we see him get into his bright
red, MUSTANG convertible.
Mikey has: UNROLLED the map. It has SURVIVED the burning
with only a tiny singed edge.
Brand TURNS to Andy. Their eyes MEET, a look of tragic
desire! They want to be together, but this isn't the
time...She FLASHES her pretty eyes. Brand sorts of melts
down.
Brand TURNS to Mikey. He GRABS the map from Mikey.
SLAPPING Mikey's head.

BRAND
Mom's waitin' for you. You just blew
your whole life, pal.
(to the other guys)
The rest of you guys, too...you're
all history. We don't need friends
like you in our lives!
With that, Brand tucks the map into his back pocket. Mouth
walks up to Brand. Mouth turns on the phony charm, putting
his arm around Brand. Mouth starts to sing.
As
MOUTH
"Here's to good friends, tonight is
kinda' special; The beer we pour,
must be something more somehow..."
he continues to sing, Mouth uses his FREE HAND to remove
the map from Brand's pocket. Brand SHOVES Mouth away.
BRAND
You don't have to drink to make
friends, wimp.
Mouth turns to the other goonies and SHOWS them the maр
They make a RUN for it. A befuddled Brand reaches into his
back pocket, realizing that the map is gone. He RUNS after
the kids.
EXT. STOP 'N SNACK - DAY
Mikey, Mouth, Data and Chunk hurriedly RIDE OFF on their
bicycles. Mouth holds THE ROLLED MAP UNDER HIS ARM. Brand
DASHES outside. He SEES the boys RIDE OFF into the
distance.

51 EXT. STREET LEADING OUT OF TOWN - DAY 51
CLOSE UP - MIKEY, checking the MAP. CAMERA PULLS BACK. The
kids are riding their bikes, moving further up the coastal
highway. The Springsteen song BLASTS from Data's stereo.
The kids CONTINUE to look back.
52 OMIT 52
53 EXT. COUNTRY CLUB ROAD - DAY 53
Chunk TURNS to his RIGHT. He sees the HILLSIDE COUNTRY
CLUB. Chunk points to the Club, looking at Data.

CHUNK
My Dad tried to join there once.
When he still had his job. But they
wouldn't let us in.
DATA
You kiddin'? They wouldn't let none
of us in. That place is kinda' like
the "Dairy Queen". They only got one
flavor.
-EXT. ROAD NEAR ROCKS - DAY
MIKEY'S P.O.V. - THREE TALL NARROW ROCKS jut out of the
ocean. In a "V" PATTERN. Mikey PAUSES. THINKING to
himself.
MIKEY
I know this place...
It HITS him. A REALIZATION! Mikey NODS to himself.
MIKEY
That's it. That's it.
CAMERA PANS FROM MIKEY. TO HIS P.O.V.: A TALL, NATURAL
OBELISK. It stretches several HUNDRED FEET into the air. A
very steep HILL. Very WIDE. Lined with JUTTING, JAGGED
rock. The Coastal Road is DIRECTLY in front of it. At the
obelisk, the road makes a SHARP TURN. Veering off into a
different DIRECTION.
55 EXT. ROAD THROUGH WOODS - DAY
Brand is way behind the kids, furiously pedaling the girl's
pink bicycle. Troy's red Mustang is.coming up behind Brand.
The Mustang starts to smoke rubber, and reduces speed from
75 to 5 MPH. The Mustang rides BESIDE Brand. Troy
CHUCKLES. Andy LOOKS away, embarrassed. Stef TURNS to
Andy.
STEF
No wonder he can't get a license.
54
Brand TURNS away. Angrily HUFFING and PUFFING. As Andy and
Stef look at Brand, Troy is slyly adjusting the rearview
mirrow, tilting it downward in order to see down into Andy's
shirt. Andy NOTICES. She GLARES at Troy.

ANDY
Troy...you touch that mirror again
and I swear to God I'll sock you in
the mouth!
Troy quickly MOVES his hand from the mirror. Andy LOOKS
BACK to Brand, trying to be NICE.
ANDY
Brand...Can we give you a lift
somewhere?
Brand SMILES, his eyes locking with Andy's in a moment that
tells us they're "communicating". Troy NOTICES this and
fumes. He forces a SMILE to Brand.
TROY
Yeah, Walsh...Grab hold of somethin'
you can handle.
Brand GRABS hold of the door handle. Troy TIGHTLY grasps
Brand's wrist. Troy TURNS UP the radio and floors the gas.
Brand is TRAPPED. The Mustang is true to its stats, it goes
from zero to sixty in 8.0 seconds...and so does Brand. The
bike pedals are churning so quickly, Brand has to lift his
feet from the bike. Andy SCREAMS.
ANDY
Troy!!! Let 'im go!!!! You're going
too fast!! You're gonna kill 'im!!!!
Let 'im go!!!
Troy NODS and releases his grip on Brand. Troy SMILES at
Brand.
TROY
So long, sucker.

The Mustang makes a SHARP TURN OFF the main road. But Brand
KEEPS going. His training wheels FALL OFF. All the rubber
on the tires peel off, smoke, and the bike moves only on the
rims, SPARKING LIKE MAD! The little bike is last seen
DISAPPEARING off the shoulder and into a field of tall
grass.
55A INSERT - EXT. ROAD WITH MOSSY TREES
The boys follow the map.

They walk their bikes across the bridge

Mikey knows where they're headed

55D INSERT - EXT. HOLLOW WITH MOSSY TREES
They continue to follow the map

55E INSERT - EXT. SPOT TO TRIANGULATE ROCKS 55E
Mikey is able to line up the 3 rocks and the lighthouse through
the notches in the coin.
56 EXT. HILL ABOVE LIGHTHOUSE- DAY 56
Mikey arrives at the top. Data and Chunk are BEHIND him,
followed by Mouth. They stand on the EDGE of the hill.
They are met with a SURPRISING SIGHT. BELOW the boys, on
the opposite side of the hill, is a tiny AREA OF LAND. A
MINI-PENNINSULA. Thrashing ocean waves and jutting rocks
surround the grassy penninsula. A small CEMETARY is built
on a small section of land. POTTER'S FIELD. Crowded with
old, crooked, GRAVESTONES. Built BESIDE the cemetary is
57 EXT. LIGHTHOUSE LOUNGE - DAY
A rectangular, ONE STORY building. RUN DOWN. DISTORTED by
the years. Its white wood exterior is CRACKED AND ROTTING.
The building is CROOKED. Its windows TWISTED and DIRTY. A
broken red and green NEON SIGN hangs over the building. A
TALL, CROOKED LÍGHTHOUSE is built beside the building. An
OPEN-CLOSED sign hangs in the front door window. The heavy
wind BLOWS the sign. SPINNING it around. We AREN'T CERTAIN
if the place is open or closéd. SHADOWS pass by the dirty
windows. There is a SINISTER, EERIE quality to this place.
Mikey STARES. In AWE. MUMBLING to himself, he excitedly
looks at the map. But the map seems to END. Mikey is
PUZZLED. He suddenly gets an idea. He FOLDS the map like
MAD MAGAZINE back cover. To Mikey's delight, the folded
pieces form another MAP. Mikey REMOVES the doubloon from
his pocket. When he PLACES the doubloon over the map,
everything appears to be more CLEAR. He gets everyones
ATTENTION, pointing to the map.
MIKEY
See this...here's where we are now.
Mikey POINTS to the "X" below the cliff. SMALL FOOTPRINTS
have been sketched on the map. They FORM a 1line from the
bottom of the hill to the "✗".
